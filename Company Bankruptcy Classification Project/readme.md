## Project Description

In this project, I have built a model to predict company bankruptcy using financial data from the Emerging Markets Information Service. The project involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and deployment.

### Steps Taken

1. **Preparatory Work - Setting the Environment & Importing the Packages:**
   - Set up the environment and imported essential packages like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `Streamlit`.

2. **Data Loading and Wrangling:**
   - Loaded the financial data.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure it was ready for analysis and modeling.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand data distribution and relationships using `pandas` and `seaborn`.

4. **Modelling:**
   - Implemented multiple models including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XGBoost using `scikit-learn`.
   - Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

5. **Evaluating and Interpreting the Fitted Models:**
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like precision, recall, f1-score, and confusion matrix.
   - Visualized model performance with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

6. **Deployment of the Fitted Model:**
   - Deployed the model using `Streamlit`, allowing users to upload their CSV files for prediction.
   - Added a feature for users to select different models for prediction.
   - Visualized prediction results, summarizing the output to enhance interpretability.

## Data

The data used in this project comes from the Emerging Markets Information Service. It includes financial information of various companies which is used to predict bankruptcy.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JackronyK/Projects_Jackrony.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Projects_Jackrony/Company\ Bankruptcy\ Classification\ Project/
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the Streamlit app:

1. Ensure you are in the project directory.
2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

Upload a CSV file containing the features, select a model, and view the predictions and visualizations.

## Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Precision:** Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
- **Recall:** Measures the ability to capture all positive instances.
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Here’s a comparison of the performance of the three models:

```

## Deployment

The model is deployed using `Streamlit`, providing an interactive web app for users to upload data and get predictions. The app also includes visualizations to summarize the prediction results.
