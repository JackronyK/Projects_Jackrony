ds-030 3. Air Quality in Nairobi
### Overview
In this project, you'll work with data from one of Africa's largest open data platforms openAfrica. You'll look at air quality data from Nairobi, Lagos, and Dar es Salaam; and build a time series model to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.

Some of the things you'll learn in this project are:

- How to get data by querying a MongoDB database.
- How to prepare time series data for analysis.
- How to build an autoregression model.
- How to improve a model by tuning its hyperparameters.
